<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< HOW TO PLAY THE GAME? >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
*****
*****    In the beginning, each player is given 3 cards. The game starts with the basic rule i.e. draw 1 card and play 1 card.  
*****    Once a player has drawn 1 card and played 1 card, the player's turn ends. If a new rule card is played, it takes 
*****	 effect immediately. New rules that override the basic rule, are placed overlapping the part they supersede. e.g. when 
*****    the basic rule is in play and a player plays a new rule 'draw limit 2', then draw limit part of the basic rule 
*****	 is overridden by the new rule 'Draw Limit 2' and the play limit part of the basic rule is retained as '1'. So, the new
*****	 rule becomes - Draw 2 cards and play 1 card. There are 2 other types of rule cards - hand limit and keeper limit.
***** 	 When any of these cards are played, these rules are added along with draw card and play limit rules.
*****	 Keepers are needed to win the game. Once a player has played his/her keeper, the card should be placed in front of 
*****	 the player. When a goal card is played, it becomes the goal of the game immediately and the previous goal, if any, 
*****	 is discarded.Each goal has a different victory condition.  The game continues until someone meets the conditions of 
*****	 the current goal.As soon as someone's collection of keepers matches the current goal, they win.
